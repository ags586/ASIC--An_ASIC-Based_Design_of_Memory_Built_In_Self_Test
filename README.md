# An ASIC-Based Design of Memory-Built-In-Self-Test (MBIST)

This work is for “Develop an ASIC-Based Design of Memory Built In Seft Test (MBIST)” project funded by Department Science and Technology of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

We achieved a dynamic VLSI architecture of Memory Built In Seft Test (MBIST), which can re-configure and adapt wide range of SRAM memory. This design integrates two testing algorithm MARCHA and APNPSP that are effective to verify memory errors.
